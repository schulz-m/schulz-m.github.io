Born in Berlin and raised up mainly in Zurich, where I have studied at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) for my Masters in Mechanical Engineering. Having worked and studied in various countries and industries around the world, I decided to pursue my biggest interest in robotics and I am currently working at [Rapyuta Robotics](http://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/) to enable the robotic revolution!

## Projects

Most of my public projects so far were in the research area of robotics, though I will try to push for some open source projects in the future that the community can hopefully profit from. 

### Pegasus Walking Robot

In my bachelors, I was a team member of [Project Pegasus](http://www.pegasus.ethz.ch/index.html), where the aim was to build a fast running, dynamic quadruped that follows a speed lane. The technical work included developing a simulation Framework in Matlab using Contact Dynamics, adapting the original control algorithms from [Marc Raibert](https://books.google.ch/books?id=EXRiBnQ37RwC&redir_esc=y) and developing State Estimators using the well known Kalman Filter framework in C++ on ROS.

### Robust State Estimate for Quadrotors

This was a 4 month project in my masters that was aimed at developing robust state estimates for a quadrotor using the least amount of sensors possible to enable a smooth landing. An important concept was the so called (and now widely used) [error-state Kalman Filter](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/jsola/JoanSola/objectes/notes/kinematics.pdf) and a ground estimation using barometer, sonar sensors and accelerometers. Some of the developed concepts could later be reused to [throw a quadrotor into the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGU1s6Y55JI).

Regarding online presence in my free time, I like to play around with design tools and photography, you can find some of my work on my [Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/144925784@N04/).
