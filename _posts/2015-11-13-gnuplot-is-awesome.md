When working with time series the desire to visualize them is quick to arise. There are many tools out there but recently one stood out: gnuplot. It has a really simple interface that allows it to be used in a very flexible manner.
It supports static plotting (i.e. from a fixed data set/file) and live plotting (streming data).

This article does not aim to provide tutorials or how tos, it holds links to some useful script tools and libraries.
